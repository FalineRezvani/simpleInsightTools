## Language Modeling

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of study combining linguistics, statistics, and machine learning.  Users might find this useful for information extraction, text summarization, question answering, or translation.

### Extractive Text Summarization with Sentence Transformers and LexRank

Using language models with pre-trained embeddings, such as [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) allows users to quickly discover similarities in text that has been parsed with a tool, such as [LexRank](https://github.com/crabcamp/lexrank/tree/dev) with the help of [sumy](https://miso-belica.github.io/sumy/) for extractive text summarization, and tokenized with a tool, such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/install.html).
